Intro
How to keep devices secure
Multi-layered security
    deeper you get in, easier it is to get caught
No such thing as perfect security
    Be aware of your threat model - what are you actually afraid of?
    Security through comparison: just be more secure than your neighbor


Security
What does it mean to be secure?
    Controlled access
    "statistically safe"


Passwords
Measuring password security:
    most common pws: #1: 123456, #2: 123456789, #3: qwerty, #4: password
Use better pws for more important accounts


Brute-Force attacks:
Progressive, repeated guessing, to try all possible pws
4-digit pw: 10^4 combinations = 10k 

01crack.py:
from string import digits # get all digits, 0-9
from itertools import product # get a fn that returns the permutation of input

# for 4 copies of each digit, print every combo of those digits
for passcode in product(digits, repeat=4): 
    print("".join(passcode))

4-letter pw: (26*2 = 52)^4 combinations = 7,311,616

# for 4 copies of each letter, print every combo of those letters
for passcode in product(ascii_letters, repeat=4): 
    print("".join(passcode))

4-character pw: (94)^4 combinations = 78,074,896

# for 4 copies of each character, print every combo of those characters
for passcode in product(ascii_letters+digits+punctuation, repeat=4): 
    print("".join(passcode))

8-character pw: (94)^8 combinations = 6,095,689,385,410,816 (~6 quadrillion)
10-char pw: ~quintillions
Yet, it's a problem if we forget our passwords or write them down.
Or to have only one password for all accounts


2 Factor Authentication
Other security options: 
    Rate-limiting
        If 1 try per minute, it takes 10k minutes (6.94 days) to try all combos
    Biometrics
        Different tradeoffs - PWs can be accessed by twins, etc.
    2fa (aka 2-step auth)
        Typically requires physical auth of some kind
        2fa codes typically expire after 1 use or x minutes


Password Managers
Software to manage passwords
secured behind one master password
Tradeoffs: 
    Your security has 1 critical point, the pw manager


Encryption
https:
    The "s" means secure against main-in-the-middle attacks
    https is not 100% but raises the bar
End-To-End Encryption:
    When using some service with a friend, secure the data you send to your 
    friend from all other parties, including the service you're using
    E2E is under attack by authorities because it prevents backdoors
