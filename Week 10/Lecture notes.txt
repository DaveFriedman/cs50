# Week 10 - Ethics

## Thanks
- Approx 19x7=133 people are on the cs50 team
- Bloopers


## Looking Back
- Went from managing spaces on screen with Mario to Finance, a full stack webapp
- key goal: computational thinking, comp-sci's version of critical thinking

How to evaulate the quality of your approach, 3 axes:
- Correctness: the solution has to work
- Design: the solution should be fast, efficient, and maintainable
- Style: good aethetics help others understand you

Abstraction: 
 - Taking complicated ideas and simplifying them so you can focus on the idea's 
    use as a building block, without worrying about the idea's implementation

Precision: 
- Covering and communicating the entire surface area of an idea, avoiding edge
    cases and unexpected behavior

Abstraction and Precision are sometimes at odds:
- Abstraction is a method to avoid some detail
- Precision improves with attention to detail


## Drawing Demos
1 student verbally describes a picture (shared only to him) to the audience
The audience tries to draw the description.
The picture is a 3-d cube.
The description was, roughly, "draw a regular hexagon with points facing up and 
down. Then from the center, draw lines from the center to the verteces."

The class is trying to describe a snowman to Prof Malan (he hasn't seen the pic)
and get him to draw it, instructing him piece by piece. 


## Ethics
Meica Magnani & Susan Kennedy
- philosophy postdocs in Harvard's Embedded Ethics program

Embedded Ethics Program: an interdisciplinary team of philosophers and computer 
    scientists working to integrate ethics into the CS curriculum
    Approach is to embed tools of ethical reasoning into CS courses.
    Ethical decisions: decisions that have social, political, or human impact

Technology has a lot of power, by extension so do those who design technology.
Social media platforms and fake news
Technology (social media platforms) has revolutionized how we get information

Before the internet, news came largely from major broadcast and print media.
They filtered information through a pretty narrow lens

Tools for thinking through content regulation:
- Understanding the problem
- Diagnosing the sources of the problem
- Brainstorming solutions

Thinking clear about Democracy:
- What is democracy?
    An idea of what political society should be, that has 3 elements:
    1) The political culture views individuals as free and equal and committed 
        to arriving at (via discourse) principles that let them work together, 
        even if they have different interests, identities, etc.
    2) Regular elections, rights of participation, and associative and 
        expressive rights that make participation both informed and effective
    3) Deliberative democracy, political discussion should appeal to reasons 
        that are suitable for cooperation (i.e.: universal reasons).
    Democracy is when we govern ourselves by collective decision-making
- What conditions support democracy?
- Are those conditions threatened?


## Looking Forward
- This might be the only comp sci course for many cs50 students
- The class may help students ask better questions, esp. technical questions
- Learn how to search for and find answers to technical questions
- Learning to read documentation
- Teaching ourselves how to learn new languages

Industry standard tools:
- WSL (Windows), Xcode (Mac)
- Git https://youtu.be/MJUJ4wbFm_A
- VS Code
- Static pages: Github pages, Netlify
- Dynamic pages: Heroku, AWS, Azure, GCP
- https://cloud.google.com/edu/students
- Staying current: Stackoverflow, Hackernews, Serverfault.com, Techcrunch


## Quiz Show
20 questions:
1) What are the steps for compiling source code to machine code?
- Preprocessing, compiling, assembling, linking
2) What is the runtime of binary search?
- O(log n)
3) Which animal was first mentioned in a cs50 lecture?
- Cat
4) Every time you malloc memory, you should also...
- Dealloc / free
5) What is a race condition?
- When 2 things happen at the same time and produce an unexpected result
6) Does zooming in on a photo let you "enhance" it to generate more detail?
- No, a photo only has a certain amount of detail (not counting ML)
7) Which is NOT a characteristic of a good hash function?
- Randomness (vs: Deterministic Output, Uniform Distribution, Efficiency)
8) What does FIFO stand for?
- First In, First Out
9) Which of the following would represent pink in RGB values?
- #ffd0e0 (vs: #0054e7, #9012a2, #e5d600)
10) In C, what code will allocate enough memory for a copy of string s?
- malloc(strlen(s)+1)
11) How should you organize your clothes to be cool?
- queue (vs: stack, dictionary, binary tree)
12) What is a segmentation fault?
- When a program tries to access memory that it shouldn't
13) What type of overflow can result from recursion without a base case?
- Stack overflow
14) In the town of Fiftyville, which 3 people witnessed the rubber duck robbery?
- Ruth, Eugene, and Raymond
15) What command-line program checks your code for memory leaks?
- valgrind (vs: clang, mkdir, make)
16) Which exists in C, but not in Python?
- do-while loops (vs: Boolean expressions, recursion, floating-point numbers)
17) What HTTP request method should be used when sending private information?
- POST
18) What data structure has constant-time lookup for words in a dictionary?
- trie (vs: linked list, binary search tree, array)
19) What is a cookie?
- Data used by to identify your computer to websites (both of the above)
20) What's your comfort level now?
- I'm among those more comfortable :)
