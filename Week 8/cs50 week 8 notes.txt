cs50 week 8:

The internet: A global network of computers

Internet data protocols: Many types, including TCP/IP

IP, Internet Protocol: how computers address each other
DNS, Domain Name System: A service, provided by your ISP, to change words in urls to IP addresses
TCP, Transmission Control Protocol: Allows different types of technologies/services to be provided by 1 server, controlled using port numbers. TCP also handles delivery and error-handling, will resend data if the send fails.

HTTP, Hyper-Text Transfer Protocol: Protocol for web browsers and web servers, describing content sent over the internet

GET: A http request to GET some data
POST

HTML: a markup language, composed of tags and attributes
f12: developer tools -> elements tab

common html tags:
<b>, <i>, <u>: bold, italic, underline
<p>: paragraphs
<h#>: header, h1 through h6, different sized headers
<ul>, <ol>, <li>: unordered lists, ordered lists, list items (which go inside lists)
<table>, <tr>, <td>: start a table, start a table's row, start a table's row's data cell (aka column)

<form>: start a form
<input name=X, type=Y/>: define a field within a form, of id X, with data type Y. Is self-closing

<div>: demarcates an arbitrary division in a page

<a href=x>: "anchor hyperlink reference = x", creates a link to a web page
<img src=x />: img tag, presents to an image. Is self-closing

<!DOCTYPE html>: announces to the browser that this webpage is using html5, allowing you to use html5-specific tags and attributes

<!-- -->: HTML comments tag


CSS: Cascading Style Sheets. A styling language, used to customize the website's look and feel. Lacks logic.

styles are constructed in the form:

selector { declaration; }, or selector { property:value; }
ex: body { background-color: blue; } makes the background color of the body turn blue

Common CSS elements and properties
border: style color width
background-color: keyword or 6-digit hex code
color: keyword or hex code (sets the foreground color, typically the text color)
font-size: absolute or relative size, can use keywords (small, medium), fixed points (10pt, 12pt), percentages (80%, 90%), or relative to prior font size (smaller, larger)
font-family: font name or generic name. Use web-safe fonts that are pre-defined in CSS
text-align: left, right, center, justify

Selectors work on html tags (body, h2, etc.) and also unique IDs that are defined in your html page. Most HTML tags can have a unique ID attribute. IDs are prefixed with a # in html

ex: #uniqueID { border: 4px dotted blue; }

Selectors can also apply to a class: any set of HTML tags that have been given a class attribute. Classes are prefixed with a .

ex: .students {background-color: yellow; opacity: 0.7; }

Linking stylesheets:
Stylesheets can be defined in the HTML page, within <style></style> tags.
However, it's better to create an external file and link it:
<head> <link href="tables.css" rel="stylesheet" /> </head>


Javascript
Include JS with <script src=file.js> tag. Can also write JS inline with HTML. Don't.

variables:
var x = 44;

Conditionals: if, else if, switch, ?:, etc. are available
Loops: while, do-while, for, are available
Functions: Of the format function Name {}, but can also be anonymous (like python lambdas)
Arrays: var nums = [1, 2, true, 3.33, "five"]; can mix types

JS can behave different ways: it can be an object-oriented language, and it can also break its own rules. 

New kinds of available loops:
for (var key in object) { /* iterate over key */ }
for (var key of object) { /* iterate over object[key] */ }

Events: A response to a user doing something (click, touch, hover, reload, etc.)


DOM, the Document Object Model

has a tree structure

Some common DOM properties and their descriptions:
innerHTML: holds the HTML inside a set of HTML tags
nodeName: the name of an HTML element or element's attribute
id: the "id" attribute of an HTML element
parentNode: refers to the node one level up
childNodes: an arry of references to the nodes one level down
attributes: an array of the attributes of an HTML element
style: an object that holds the CSS/HTML styling of an element

Some common DOM elements and their descriptions:
getElementById(id): gets the element with the given ID
getElementsByTagName(tag): gets all the elements with a given tag
appendChild(node): Add the given node to the DOM
removeChild(node): Remove the given child node from the DOM

jQuery: a simplified way to work with the DOM
Probably the most popular JS library

basic JS fn to change background color:
document.getElementById('colorDiv').style.backgroundColor = 'green'
in jQuery:
$('#colorDiv').css('background-color', 'green');
